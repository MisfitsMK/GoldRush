# Gold Rush - Angular 2 Demo App
By MisfitsMK (https://misfits.ninja/)

## Description
**Gold Rush** is a working name for a test Angular 2 web app that I built to learn the Angular framework.  You can find all the documentation and walkthrough to build a similar app for yourself here (https://angular.io/)

## Installation
Download the files to your computer
You will need to install NodeJS to run the local server (https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to this folder in the terminal
Run the following command to install the node dependencies, it may take some time:

```console
npm install
```

There is a lightweight python server called 'lite server' that will run the web app services on 'localhost:3000'. To run the server and launch the web app run the following command:
```console
npm start
```
A new browser window should launch and show the default page for the web app.

## Usage

This is just a demo. It has a router and a few view components:
 
- Dashboard View, see your employees and also the main play field
- Employees View, see the full list of employees you can hire and also get their details
- Employee Detail View, see details about a specific employee
- Shop View, see the shop and items to purchase
